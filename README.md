Wordle with a slight twist

For this program you can choose either to play  a three letter or five letter Wordle board game.  The Wordle text file consist of sorted three and five letter words.

Indicators will be given if characters of the user-entered word are reflected in the guessed word.  Example 3-letter word:  fan

# If the character is in the correct position, the character will display as an uppercase value.  

Example:


  Random word:  fan
  
  Guessed word:   sad
  
  Output:  [ * ]  [ A ]  [ * ]
  
  
# If the character is within the random word, the character will display as a lowercase value.

Example:


  Random word: fan
  
  Guessed word: net
  
  Output: [ n ]  [ * ]  [ * ]
  
  
# If you enter a character that is not in the word, an asterisk '*' will display.

Example:

  
  Random word: fan
  
  Guessed word: tic
  
  Output: [ * ]  [ * ]  [ * ]
